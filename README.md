# Code-Louisville

LB's Code Louisville Front End Development Final Project This is a fun and website for a business in which I did exist. Basically, this was a fun way to learn coding and serve as a way to pay tribute to my loyal companion, Bear. My 16 year old Yorkie serves as the lead detective of my agency.
